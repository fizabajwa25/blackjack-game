# Blackjack Game

## Project Overview
This is an interactive Blackjack game developed in Java using JavaFX. The project simulates the logic and interface of a standard Blackjack game while offering a clean and accessible graphical interface. It was designed as a way to strengthen object-oriented programming skills and practice GUI development.

## Objectives and Goals
- Apply principles of object-oriented programming to game logic.
- Build a user-friendly graphical interface using JavaFX.
- Incorporate Figma-based UI design into a functioning Java desktop app.
- Improve skills in GUI event handling, class structuring, and game logic flow.

## Tech Stack
- Language: Java
- Framework: JavaFX
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
- Design Tool: Figma

## Features
- Real-time game logic with full support for Hit, Stand, and Reset options.
- Pop-up window that explains game rules to new users.
- Game state tracking with score display and conditional win/loss evaluation.
- Clean modular design using classes such as `Card`, `Deck`, `GameEngine`, and `UIHandler`.
